# 4. XOOPS built-in form class



1. PHP's Class \(class\) is an object blueprint
2. To make the Class effective, you need to go through the action of materialization \(new\): $object = new PHP\_Class\(\);
3. Objects have so-called methods \(methods\), which are actually functions, allowing you to set, value, or perform specific object functions on this object: $object-&gt;method\(\);
4. After setting the form objects of XOOPS, you need to do $object-&gt;render\(\); to generate code.
5. For detailed XOOPS form categories, please refer to: [http://api.xoops.org/2.5.9/class-XoopsForm.html](http://api.xoops.org/2.5.9/class-XoopsForm.html)
