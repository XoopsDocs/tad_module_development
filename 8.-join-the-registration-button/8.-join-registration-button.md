# 8. Join registration button

1. Next, please log in to the website as a general user. We hope to see the "Sign up" button in the list.

   ```text
   <{if $xoops_isadmin}>
     <a href="javascript:delete_action(<{$action.action_id}>)" class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">刪除</a>
     <a href="admin/main.php?action_id=<{$action.action_id}>" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">編輯</a>
   <{elseif $xoops_isuser and !$action.overdue}>  
     <a href="index.php?action_id=<{$action.action_id}>&op=signup" class="btn btn-success btn-xs">我要報名</a>
   <{/if}>
   ```

2. Among them! $action.overdue means that the unexpired activities are only shown.
3. We changed the identification tags to use &lt;{$xoops\_isadmin}&gt; and &lt;{$xoops\_isuser}&gt;, which seems to be more consistent.
4. XOOPS provides many built-in tags in the template that can be used directly \( [there is also a full version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ohiUOa1EqDBzWBivTG3-gyRYW5c5vRqpKfCplTOoOLo/edit#gid=0) \):
