# 2. Database planning

#### 1. Planning data table structure

1. It is recommended to use spreadsheet software, such as [Calc or Excel, to plan](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/file/29/signup.xlsx) \(including complete structure and simulation data\), and by the way imagine the required functions and fields.
2. After being roughly determined, use database management software such as adminer or phpMyAdmin to create the data tables required by the program

#### 2. Use adminer to create database and table

1. Connect to http://localhost/modules/tad\_adm/pma.php
2. The default account secret is root and 2130669\#33 \(or the password you set yourself\)
3. Click "Create Data Sheet", select "utf8\_general\_ci" for proofreading, and create related data sheets in sequence. Below is the actions data sheet \(after the module is installed, it will become xx\_actions\) ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/29/db1.png)
4. Please set uid to mediumint. This is the user ID of the built-in users table in XOOPS. The default format is mediumint.
5. After submitting, check whether the main index has been created. If not, make sure that the serial number field has "AI" checked, and manually create the main index field.![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/29/db3.png)
6. If the main index is composed of two fields, please do not set AI \(auto-increment\), the following is the signups table \(it will become xx\_signups after the module is installed\) ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/29/db2.png)
7. And use "Modify Index" to manually add the main index. ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/29/db4.png)
8. Then, set the fields to be combined into the main index ![](https://campus-xoops.tn.edu.tw/uploads/tad_book3/image/29/db5.png)
